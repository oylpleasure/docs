# Setup Your Wallet

:::tip Wallet Compatibility

**OylNet version of Oyl AMM currently only works with the Oyl Wallet browser extension.**

- In upcoming phases (Signet & Mainnet), **all Bitcoin wallets** will be able to sign Alkanes transactions directly on the Dapp.
- We’re partnering with other wallet providers to expand compatibility and make your experience even smoother.
