# Pools Overview

This guide explains how to use the Pools feature in the Oyl platform to provide liquidity and earn fees.

## Understanding Liquidity Pools

Liquidity pools are collections of funds locked in smart contracts that facilitate trading by providing liquidity. As a liquidity provider, you can:

- Earn fees from trades that occur in your pool
- Support the Oyl ecosystem by increasing available liquidity
- Potentially earn additional rewards through yield farming

## Accessing Pools

1. **Navigate to Pools**
   - Click on "Pools" in the left sidebar menu
   - The main Pools page will display available pools and your current positions

2. **Understanding the Pools Interface**
   - **Your Positions**: Shows your active liquidity positions
   - **Top Pools by TVL**: Lists the most popular pools by Total Value Locked
   - **Pool Metrics**: Displays APR (Annual Percentage Rate), TVL, and 30-day volume

## Creating a New Position

To provide liquidity to a pool:

1. Click the "New Position" button at the top of the Pools page
2. Select the tokens you want to provide:
   - Choose the first token from the top dropdown
   - Choose the second token from the bottom dropdown
3. Specify the amount of each token you want to contribute
   - You can click "Max" to use your entire balance
   - The system will automatically calculate the required amounts based on the current pool ratio
4. Review the details of your position
5. Click "Input Amount" and confirm the transaction in your wallet

## Pool Types and Features

The Oyl platform supports various pool types:

- **Standard Pools**: Traditional 50/50 weighted pools
- **Concentrated Liquidity Pools**: Allow you to provide liquidity within specific price ranges
- **Stable Pools**: Optimized for stablecoins and assets that maintain similar values

## Pool Performance Metrics

For each pool, you can view important metrics:

- **APR (Annual Percentage Rate)**: Estimated yearly return from trading fees
- **TVL (Total Value Locked)**: Total value of assets in the pool
- **Volume (30d)**: Trading volume over the last 30 days
- **Pool Ranking**: Numbered ranking based on TVL

## Managing Your Positions

After creating a position, you can:

1. **Monitor Performance**: Track fees earned and value changes
2. **Add Liquidity**: Increase your position in an existing pool
3. **Remove Liquidity**: Withdraw part or all of your position
4. **Collect Fees**: Harvest trading fees earned from your position

## Pool Risks and Considerations

When providing liquidity, be aware of:

- **Impermanent Loss**: Potential value loss compared to holding assets when prices change
- **Smart Contract Risk**: Risk associated with the underlying smart contracts
- **Market Risk**: General market volatility affecting asset prices

## Testing with Oylnet

When using pools in the Oylnet testing environment:

- All transactions use test tokens and do not involve real money
- You can experiment with different pool strategies without risk
- Use test tokens from the Oylnet faucet to create positions

Remember that pool APRs and performance metrics in Oylnet may not reflect real-world conditions and are primarily for testing purposes.
