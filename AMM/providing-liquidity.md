# Providing Liquidity

This guide explains how to provide liquidity to the AMM pools and earn rewards.

## Understanding Liquidity Provision

When you provide liquidity to an AMM pool, you're depositing an equal value of two tokens. In return, you receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens that represent your share of the pool.

## Steps to Provide Liquidity

1. Navigate to the "Pool" section of the interface
2. Click on "Add Liquidity"
3. Select the token pair you wish to provide liquidity for
4. Enter the amount of one token, and the interface will automatically calculate the required amount of the other token
5. Review the details, including your share of the pool
6. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

## LP Tokens and Rewards

After providing liquidity, you'll receive LP tokens that represent your share of the pool. These tokens:

- Automatically earn fees from trades in the pool
- Can be staked in farming pools for additional rewards
- Can be redeemed at any time to withdraw your liquidity

## Impermanent Loss

Be aware that providing liquidity exposes you to impermanent loss, which occurs when the price ratio of your deposited tokens changes compared to when you deposited them.
