# Connecting Your Wallet

This guide will walk you through the process of connecting your wallet to the AMM platform.

## Supported Wallets

Our AMM platform supports the following wallets:

- Wallet A
- Wallet B
- Wallet C

## Connection Steps

1. Click on the "Connect Wallet" button in the top-right corner of the interface
2. Select your preferred wallet from the list
3. Follow the wallet-specific prompts to authorize the connection
4. Select the appropriate network (Mainnet for real assets or Oylnet for testing)
5. Once connected, your wallet address will appear in the interface

## Connecting to Oylnet

For testing purposes, we recommend connecting to the Oylnet testing environment first:

1. In your wallet, add a custom network with the following details:
   - Network Name: Oylnet
   - Network Type: Regtest
   - RPC URL: https://regtest.oyl.io
   - Chain ID: 18444
2. Select Oylnet as your active network
3. Request test tokens from the Oylnet faucet

Remember that Oylnet is a testing environment and does NOT use real money. All transactions on Oylnet are for testing purposes only.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues connecting your wallet:

- Make sure your wallet is unlocked
- Check that you're on the correct network
- Clear your browser cache and try again
- Ensure you have the latest version of your wallet extension
