# Pool

Oyl lets you provide liquidity to pools and earn rewards. Follow these steps to create a position and manage your liquidity:

## 1. Open the Pools Tab

Go to the "Pool" section in the Oyl app to see available liquidity pools.


You can select the **My Wallet** filter to show only pools that are available to supply to, based on the assets currently in your wallet.

## 2. Drill Down Into a Pool

Click on any pool to view detailed stats about the pool, such as current liquidity, pool composition, and APY. If you already have a position in this pool, you’ll also see your current positions and rewards.
