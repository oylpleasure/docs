# Swap

The Swap page lets you easily exchange tokens on Oyl. Here’s how to use it:

## 1. Default Swap Screen

When you open the Swap page, the swap block is preloaded with `frBTC` as the asset to sell. The assets you can buy are already listed and open below—simply tap on any asset to select it, or use the search bar to quickly find the token you want to receive.

*Input the amount you want to swap.*

- Enter how much you want to **sell** or **buy**—you can input in either token.
- The block will automatically calculate the corresponding amount and generate a real-time quote for your swap.

### Understanding the Swap Receipt

The receipt section will display:
- **Exchange Rate:** The current rate between the two tokens.
- **Slippage:** The maximum price movement you’re willing to accept (protects you from large price swings).
- **Fees:** Any fees associated with the swap.
- **Estimated Received:** The amount you’ll get after all calculations.
