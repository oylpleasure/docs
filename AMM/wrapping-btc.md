# Wrapping BTC

This guide explains how to wrap and unwrap Bitcoin (BTC) on the Oyl platform.

## What is Wrapped Bitcoin (frBTC)?

Wrapped Bitcoin (frBTC) is a tokenized version of Bitcoin that allows you to use your BTC within the Oyl ecosystem. By wrapping your BTC, you can:

- Participate in liquidity pools
- Swap for other tokens
- Earn fees from providing liquidity
- Use your BTC in various DeFi applications

frBTC maintains a 1:1 peg with BTC, meaning 1 frBTC is always redeemable for 1 BTC.

2. **Select Amount to Wrap**
