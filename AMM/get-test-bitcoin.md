# Get Test Bitcoin

Trying out Oyl is easy and free. You can get test Bitcoin directly from inside the app, without leaving the Portfolio view.

If your portfolio is empty, you’ll see a prompt to get started:

- These tokens will appear in your portfolio automatically.

Once you have your test Bitcoin, you can:

> **Tip:** The faucet is only available in the testing environment. If you don’t see it, make sure you’re using the OylNet test network.
