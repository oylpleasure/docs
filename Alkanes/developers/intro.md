# Alkanes: A New Era for Bitcoin

Alkanes is Bitcoin's first native smart contract platform and asset class. It empowers developers to build trustless decentralized applications and introduces a new category of programmable tokens that leverage Bitcoin's unparalleled security and decentralization.

:::tip The Genesis is Here
The Alkanes indexer is live on mainnet. You're early to a transformative moment in Bitcoin's evolution.

## Why Build on Alkanes?

By introducing a smart contract framework directly on Bitcoin's UTXO model, Alkanes eliminates the need for sidechains or external protocols. Its indexing layer interprets and executes complex contract logic while staying anchored to Bitcoin's core. This enables fully trustless systems like AMMs, lending, and stablecoins to run seamlessly on the most secure blockchain.

The power of Alkanes lies in its native integration with Bitcoin. No more compromises with wrapped tokens or cross-chain bridges. Your applications run directly on Bitcoin L1, leveraging its unmatched security and network effect. This is true decentralization, built on the foundation that started it all.

## Build Without Limits

Alkanes uses WebAssembly (WASM) to connect Bitcoin scripting with the vast ecosystem of open-source tooling. This breakthrough enables developers to build trustless applications in familiar languages. Programmable logic, such as automated lending or dynamic fee adjustments, unlocks decentralized finance, tokenized assets, and scalable systems while preserving Bitcoin's security and decentralization.

Our architecture is designed for the future. The Metashrew indexing layer provides real-time state processing with automatic reorg handling, while parallel execution of view functions ensures your applications remain responsive at scale. This is the infrastructure Bitcoin has been waiting for.

## The Technology That Makes It Possible

At the heart of Alkanes is a revolutionary smart contract layer that brings full programmability to Bitcoin. Through WebAssembly, you can write complex contract logic that executes directly on Bitcoin's UTXO model. The Protorunes protocol enables efficient token operations and state management, while our comprehensive development framework provides everything you need to build and deploy with confidence.

The Metashrew architecture ensures your applications run smoothly, with optimized data structures for quick access and robust simulation capabilities for testing. This isn't just another layer on Bitcoin—it's a complete reimagining of what's possible on the world's most secure blockchain.

## The Future is Open Source

Nobody will build it for us. This is the frontier of Bitcoin's evolution, and you're here before the crowd. Alkanes unlocks the tools to create the next wave of decentralized finance, programmable assets, and trustless systems. The blueprint for Bitcoin's future isn't written—it's yours to design.

Imagine AMMs that leverage Bitcoin's native security, lending platforms that operate without intermediaries, and governance systems that truly cannot be captured. With Alkanes, these aren't just possibilities—they're the building blocks of a new financial system.
