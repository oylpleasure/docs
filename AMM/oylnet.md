# Oylnet Test Network

import OylNetVideo from '@site/src/components/OylNetVideo';

<OylNetVideo />

## What is Oylnet?

Oylnet is a shared regtest environment and living testbed for all generalized **Alkanes** testing. It is purpose-built for developers to deploy, experiment with, and iterate on new and existing WASM smart contracts. Oylnet enables:

- Testing and development of Alkanes metaprotocol features
- Safe experimentation with new contract designs and upgrades
- Collaboration and rapid prototyping for the Alkanes ecosystem

To learn more about Alkanes and the metaprotocol, visit the canonical developer docs at [alkanes.build](https://alkanes.build).

## Important Notice

**Oylnet is NOT a production environment and does NOT use real money.**

All tokens, transactions, and balances on Oylnet are for testing purposes only and have no real-world value. This environment allows you to:

- Experiment with the AMM platform features
- Test liquidity provision and token swaps
- Practice managing positions
- Understand the platform mechanics without financial risk

## Getting Test Tokens

To use the Oylnet testing environment:

1. Connect your wallet to the Oylnet network
2. Use the faucet to request test tokens
3. These tokens have no real value and are provided solely for testing purposes

## Network Details

When connecting to Oylnet, use the following network parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Network Name | Oylnet |
| Network Type | Regtest |
| RPC URL | https://regtest.oyl.io |
| Chain ID | 18444 |

## Best Practices for Testing

When using Oylnet:

- Test all features thoroughly before using them on mainnet
- Report any bugs or issues you encounter
- Remember that performance on Oylnet may differ slightly from mainnet
- Use Oylnet to familiarize yourself with the platform before using real funds
