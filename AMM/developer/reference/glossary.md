# Glossary

Comprehensive glossary of terms used in the Oyl AMM protocol and DeFi ecosystem.

## A

**Alkanes**
The metaprotocol that enables smart contracts on Bitcoin, providing the runtime environment for the Oyl AMM protocol.

**AMM (Automated Market Maker)**
A type of decentralized exchange protocol that uses mathematical formulas to price assets and enable trading without traditional order books.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
A set of protocols and tools for building software applications, defining how software components should interact.

**APY (Annual Percentage Yield)**
The real rate of return earned on an investment, taking into account the effect of compounding interest.

**Arbitrage**
The practice of taking advantage of price differences between different markets or exchanges to make a profit.

## B

**Bitcoin**
The first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, serving as the base layer for the Alkanes metaprotocol.

**Basis Points (bps)**
A unit of measure used to describe the percentage change in financial instruments. One basis point equals 0.01%.

## C

**Callback**
A function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation has been completed.

**Cellpack**
A data structure in the Alkanes runtime used to package function calls and parameters.

**Constant Product Formula**
The mathematical formula (x * y = k) used by AMMs to determine token prices and maintain liquidity pool balance.

**Cumulative Price**
The sum of prices over time, used in oracle systems to calculate time-weighted average prices (TWAP).

## D

**Deadline**
A timestamp after which a transaction will be rejected, used to prevent transactions from being executed at unfavorable prices due to delays.

**DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**
A blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries.

## F

**Factory Contract**
The main contract that creates and manages all trading pairs in the Oyl AMM protocol.

**Flash Swap**
A feature that allows users to borrow tokens from a liquidity pool without collateral, as long as they return the tokens (plus fees) in the same transaction.

**Fee**
A charge for using the AMM protocol. Oyl AMM charges a 0.5% total fee (0.3% to liquidity providers, 0.2% protocol fee).

**Fuel**
The computational effort required to execute operations on alkanes. Contracts at minimum have 3.5 million fuel units.

## I

**Impermanent Loss**
The temporary loss of funds experienced by liquidity providers due to volatility in a trading pair.

**Invariant**
A mathematical property that remains constant. In AMMs, the constant product (k = x * y) is the invariant.

## L

**Liquidity**
The availability of liquid assets to a market or company, or the ease with which assets can be converted to cash.

**Liquidity Pool**
A collection of funds locked in a smart contract, used to facilitate decentralized trading and lending.

**Liquidity Provider (LP)**
A user who deposits tokens into a liquidity pool to earn fees from trades.

**LP Token**
A token that represents a liquidity provider's share of a liquidity pool.

## M

**Market Maker**
An entity that provides liquidity to a market by being ready to buy or sell at publicly quoted prices.

**Metaprotocol**
A protocol that operates on top of another blockchain protocol, extending its functionality.

**Multi-hop Swap**
A swap that routes through multiple pools to exchange tokens that don't have a direct trading pair.

## O

**Opcode**
An operation code that specifies the operation to be performed in smart contract functions.

**Oracle**
A service that provides external data to blockchain networks and smart contracts.

**Oyl AMM**
The automated market maker protocol built on Bitcoin using the Alkanes metaprotocol.

## P

**Pool**
A smart contract that holds reserves of two tokens and facilitates trading between them.

**Price Impact**
The effect that a trade has on the price of a token, typically larger for bigger trades or in pools with less liquidity.

**Protocol Fee**
A fee collected by the protocol itself, separate from fees paid to liquidity providers.

## R

**Reserves**
The amounts of each token held in a liquidity pool.

**Reentrancy**
A vulnerability where a function can be called recursively before the first execution is complete.

**Router**
A contract that finds optimal paths for multi-hop swaps across multiple pools.

## S

**Slippage**
The difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed.

**Smart Contract**
A self-executing contract with terms directly written into code.

**Swap**
The exchange of one token for another through a liquidity pool.

## T

**Token**
A digital asset that represents ownership of an asset or access to a service.

**TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)**
An average price calculated over a specific time period, used to reduce the impact of price manipulation.

## U

**Uniswap V2**
A popular AMM protocol that inspired many similar protocols, including aspects of the Oyl AMM design.

## V

**Volatility**
A measure of how much the price of an asset fluctuates over time.

## W

**WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin)**
A tokenized version of Bitcoin that can be used in DeFi protocols.

## Y

**Yield**
The income return on an investment, typically expressed as an annual percentage.

**Yield Farming**
The practice of earning rewards by providing liquidity or staking tokens in DeFi protocols.

## Mathematical Terms

**Constant Product**
The mathematical relationship x * y = k that maintains balance in AMM pools.

**Square Root**
A mathematical function used in LP token calculations, particularly for initial liquidity provision.

**Precision**
The number of decimal places used in calculations to maintain accuracy.

---

## Technical Terms

**AlkaneId**
A unique identifier for contracts and tokens in the Alkanes runtime.

**CallResponse**
The return value from a smart contract function call.

**MessageDispatch**
A pattern used in Alkanes contracts to route different types of function calls.

**Transfer Parcel**
A data structure used to transfer tokens between contracts in the Alkanes runtime.
