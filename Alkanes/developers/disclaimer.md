# You are early.

You've discovered Alkanes. We've built a complete vertical stack for Bitcoin development - from low-level script to high-level tooling. We've solved Bitcoin's computational limitations by working with its constraints, not against them.

:::warning
Important: You're working with bleeding-edge Bitcoin technology. While our core architecture is battle-tested, you should:

- Run extensive tests before mainnet deployment
- Start with conservative value amounts
- Be ready for rapid protocol iterations
- Stay connected with core developers

This is the frontier of Bitcoin development. Proceed accordingly.
:::

Here's what makes Alkanes different:

- We embrace Bitcoin's UTXO model instead of fighting it
- Our stack turns Bitcoin's constraints into features
- Zero compromises on Bitcoin's security guarantees
- Everything is built on pure Bitcoin primitives
- The entire system is designed to be hackable and composable

What you can build today:

- Trustless protocols that leverage Bitcoin's native security
- Complex state machines without sidechains
- Pure Bitcoin smart contracts with no additional consensus rules
- Novel token systems and DeFi primitives

We've built the foundation. The tools work. The architecture is sound. Now it's time for developers like you to push the boundaries of what's possible on Bitcoin.

Ready to build? The infrastructure is here. Let's see what you create. ðŸ”“
