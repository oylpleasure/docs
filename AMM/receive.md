## 2. Choose Your Address Type

Oyl Wallet provides both Segwit and Taproot addresses:

- **Segwit address**: Use this to receive Bitcoin (BTC). Segwit addresses are compatible with most Bitcoin wallets and exchanges.
- **Taproot address**: Use this to receive Ordinals, BRC-20, Runes, and Alkanes tokens. Taproot is required for advanced Bitcoin assets and smart contracts.

You can easily switch between address types in the receive tab.

## 3. Copy and Share Your Address

- Use the "Copy" button to copy your selected address.
- Share this address with the sender.
- Monitor your portfolio for incoming transactions.

> **Tip:** Always double-check which asset youâ€™re receiving and use the correct address type. Send Alkanes to your Taproot address, and spend Bitcoin from your Segwit address.
