# Swapping Tokens

This guide explains how to swap tokens using our AMM platform.

## Understanding Token Swaps

Token swaps on our AMM platform are executed against liquidity pools rather than a traditional order book. The price you receive depends on the ratio of tokens in the pool and the size of your trade.

## Steps to Swap Tokens

1. Navigate to the "Swap" section of the interface
2. Select the token you want to swap from in the top input field
3. Select the token you want to receive in the bottom input field
4. Enter the amount you want to swap
5. Review the exchange rate, price impact, and other details
6. Click "Swap" and confirm the transaction in your wallet

## Slippage Tolerance

Slippage occurs when the price changes between the time you submit a transaction and when it's confirmed on the blockchain. You can set your slippage tolerance by:

1. Clicking the settings icon near the swap interface
2. Setting your preferred slippage tolerance percentage
3. Higher slippage tolerance increases the chance of your transaction being successful, but may result in a less favorable price

## Price Impact

Price impact shows how much your trade will move the market price. Larger trades relative to the pool size will have a higher price impact, resulting in a less favorable exchange rate.
