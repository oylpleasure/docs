# Wrap Bitcoin

Wrapping Bitcoin in Oyl simulates converting your BTC into **frBTC alkane**, a test token that can be used in swaps and to provide liquidity on the platform. This helps you explore DeFi features on Oylnet without using real Bitcoin.

## How Wrapping Works

- When you wrap BTC, you receive frBTC alkane tokens in your portfolio.
- These tokens can be used just like real wrapped Bitcoin: swap them for other tokens or supply them to pools for liquidity rewards.
- On Oylnet, this process is for testing and simulation only—no real Bitcoin is moved.

## Step 1: Open the Wrap BTC Tab

Navigate to the Wrap BTC section in the Oyl app.

## Step 2: Input Amount is Locked

- The input amount for wrapping is **locked to 0.1 BTC**.
- There’s no need to enter a number—just proceed with the default value.

## Step 3: Sign the Transaction

After confirming, you will be prompted to sign the transaction in your wallet.
