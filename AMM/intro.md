## Oyl Protocol
The Oyl Protocol is a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together form a Bitcoin-native AMM. It facilitates peer-to-peer market making, liquidity provisioning, and token swaps settled directly on Bitcoin.

## Oyl AMM Interface
The Oyl AMM Interface is one of many ways to interact with the Oyl Protocol. It provides a user-friendly web interface for swapping tokens, adding liquidity, and tracking markets.
